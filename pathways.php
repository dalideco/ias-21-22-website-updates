									"IEEE was the first club that I decided to be part of in university. In my second year, it changed my perception of education: it has taught me a lot of new things and introduced me to the right people who never failed to push me and encourage me to give my best. I volunteered in different positions, and I thought 'that was it'. But then I realized that I have never had the courage to step in and run for a front-line position, one like the chairwoman of INSAT IAS! And here I am! I am very grateful for the opportunities that IAS has given me, and I cannot wait to give back and carry on the amazing work the past committees have done. Any final words? Join IAS for a wonderful journey of learning and networking! ",

I met great people, developed my soft and technical skills and learned a lot. It made me grow! I knew right then that that was only the beginning of my path with IEEE family. This what I learnt: through life you won’t find success by doing nothing but it can be made when you embrace and commit to life-changing positive habits. All I can tell you is push yourself because no else is going to do it for you, open up and go beyond your comfort zone to discover who you really are and what you really want.",

I personally feel that IAS INSAT Student Chapter is my door-opener. Through constructive experiences, it deepens my knowledge and broadens my professional horizons. And thanks to my position in the IAS executive board I can influence and get influenced: I will get to help other students chase their own opportunities and allow myself to think and reflect alongside future Tunisian leaders.

Having the opportunity to be surrounded by professional and hardworking people only encouraged me to overcome my weaknesses and take a leap of faith to the unknown, opening up a world of opportunities which led to the improvement of both my soft and technical skills. And as we always say, IEEE IAS Insat is more than just a chapter, it's a family ! ",

I’ve always believed that there was a lot of potential in this society for applied chemistry-biology students like myself to exploit and benefit from, waiting for someone to reveal it. And I’ve been striving ever since to seek it out. I find myself now, as general secretary, more capable of sharing the opportunities I’ve had with my fellows. I encourage everyone to embark on this journey with us and pursue that same potential to benefit themselves and their peers. ",

It's about a whole life, it’s about relations you establish, about the sense of family that is born into our community and it's about responsibilities and group management. IAS helped me not only on developing my soft skills but on enlarging my professional network. It taught me a lot about my career as an instrumentation and maintenance engineer and made me realize that I was way behind when it comes to dealing with real industry equipment. I’m sure that this is only the begging and that being a part of IEEE family is the part of my life which is going to make of me a potential leader.
