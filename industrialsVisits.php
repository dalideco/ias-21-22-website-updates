The center's multidisciplinary infrastructure allows for this specific training, as well as an opportunity to be open to both national and international enterprises.

the attendees learned about the courses that personnel take to familiarize themselves with the different procedures and precautions they need to take in their line of work and got an extensive explanation of the multiple types and hazards encountered during cable installations.
