            <h3>5th Anniversary celebration with a teambuilding , Yoga and laughter Yoga </h3> 
            Since the vision for this year includes implementing strategies to increase member engagement and involvement, and in order to create a friendly ambiance fit for the activities that had been planned, IEEE IAS INSAT SBC celebrated its 5th Anniversary by holding a teambuilding session in Tunis’ Japanese garden. The teambuilding consisted of two sessions of Yoga and laughter Yoga, instructed by professional yoga trainer Mayssa Ghirbi. The participants expressed great relief in practicing yoga and felt relaxed and well-rested. A cake was then presented by the IAS chapter board as a celebration of the chapter’s 5th anniversary. This was an opportunity for everyone to converse and interact with each other. The teambuilding was ended by a laughter yoga session that was well received by the participants as it provided a window of opportunity for relaxation and stress relief.

            <h3>INSAT SB teambuilding</h3> 
            On Sunday , 8th of September, IEEE INSAT SB organized its very first teambuilding in Ice Park, La Marsa. The executive board, chapter chaisr, affinity group chair, and all their respective executive teams all went ice-skating after an exhausting, but fruitful 3 days of organizing Summer School 2.0 and ensuring the best learning experience for all the participants. This was a chance to laugh, alleviate the stress and tiredness, and end our very first event together on a good note. The teams got to know each other and have fun! The connection they built is necessary as it sets a solid ground for collaboration, teamwork and reminds everyone of IEEE’s sole and common goal : advancing technology for humanity!               </div>

            IAS is about having fun too!
As a teambuilding, we chose to spend the whole Sunday at Sidi Bou Saïd's park. We took advantage of the good weather by alternating between several games and fun activities making us closer and more united as a team and as an IAS family.
Everyone had fun and enjoyed their time. We would like to thank our dear members for making the day so exceptional and such a fun day !
