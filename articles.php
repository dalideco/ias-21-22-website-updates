            « You become what you think about all day long. ».
            But how could you think about something you have never seen? .....

           « You become what you think about all day long. ».
           But how could you think about something you have never seen? Is it even possible to imagine what you want to do a few years later as an engineer, working in the industrial field when you have no idea of what is going on inside a factory ?
           
           <br><br>Pushed by the desire to make students aware of the industrialist’s expectations from the fresh engineers, IEEE IAS Chapter INSAT SB team arranged a number of industrial visits during this academic year, and the first one took place yesterday, on March 30th 2016. In fact, a group of 14 students, studying in the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology, had the opportunity to visit LEONI Wiring Systems, Susah.
           Indeed, the working of industrial equipments in running conditions was explained to the students, enabling them to understand the functioning of different machines and get answers to their questions.
           
           <br><br>After a few hours spent in this factory, every student gained a nonesuch experience that will certainly influence their future career choices and decisions. But this is just the beginning as future visits are already planned and will be, hopefully as successful as the first one. Stay tuned …
           
           <br><br>About LEONI : The official opening of a LEONI subsidiary in Tunisia was in 1977. Since then, LEONI subsidiaries have become the biggest private employers in Tunisia, counting 13520 employees -276 of whom are engineers-. This number represents 19,4% of the total number of LEONI employees worldwide. For decades, LEONI clients have been the most renowned automakers: Audi, VW, BMW, and Mercedes, which is the most important client currently. About the visit … After 30 minutes presentation of LEONI, during which its various aspects were discussed in great details, all the participants were allowed to an industrial visit on the field of production of automotive wiring systems manufactured for “Porsche Panamera” and “Audi A4”. This visit was insured by the training manager Mr. Jamel Graiet.

           The story of women's struggle for equality belongs to no single feminist nor to any one organization but to the collective efforts of all who care about human rights, says world-renowned feminist, journalist and social and political activist Gloria Steinem.

           <br><br>Thus International Women's Day is all about unity, celebration, reflection, advocacy and action, whatever that looks like globally at a local level. But one thing is for sure, International Women's Day has been occurring for well over a century, and continues to grow from strength to strength. As a celebration for this sacred day, IEEE IAS INSAT SB chapter in collaboration with IEEE WIE INSAT Affinity Group organized “Women in Industry”. An event that cherish the women’s work and contribution in the industry as engineers and leaders.

<br><br>Since it is very important to connect with other female professionals who’s taking the step forward in the engineering fields and industry, we invited Mrs Nejiba BOUZAIANE KHALFALLAH.

<br><br>Mrs Nejiba is the general manager of EPI Solutions, a certified trainer at UNIDO, a master trainer at Women’s Enterprise for Sustainability, a telecommunication engineer but before all she’s a leader and a loved mother and wife.
During our talk, Mrs Nejiba told us her story and struggle to gain her position in the industry and build her first company in the 90’s after her trip to USA. She encourage all attendees to pursue their dreams and ambition and never underestimate their self “Be Bold for Change”. Mrs Nejiba highlights the fact that being a woman and engineer is neither that easy nor that hard. Because as an engineer you have the tools to change the world and to solve humanity’s most faced problems. In the other hand as a woman, everything that you’re about to do will have a deep impact on the society and on the other girls and women who follow your steps.

<br><br>After our talk, we watched a movie “Hidden Figures” which is a biographical drama film. It is a story of a team of female African-American mathematicians who served a vital role in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) during the early years of the U.S. space program.
